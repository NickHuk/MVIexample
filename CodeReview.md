  <summary><h2> 💡 Tips</h2></summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove old local branches <code>git remote prune<remote></code> in order to find the target branch faster locally</li>
  </ul>
</details>

## 🤔 Points for consideration
- [ ] Merge condition
- [ ] PRs priority (high/medium/low priority). Higher priority PR should be reviewed first.
- [ ] PR impact (high/medium/low). Low-impact standalone PRs could be merged with less number of reviews.
- [ ] Prioritize merging PRs over developing new features (potential merge conflicts)
- [ ] Deadlines for reviewing PR’s - allows decrease a number of re-reviews of every single reviewer. Split review process into iterations:
    “review” → “addressing comments” → “re-review” →  “addressing comments” 
    Aim: avoid frequently switching contexts, reduce number of re-reviews
    PR statuses
- [ ] Reviews limit (e.g. no more than 3 reviews including code owners)
- [ ] High-level plan of merging all of the PRs
- [ ] How to deal with legacy, should we review it?
